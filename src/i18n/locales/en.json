      "iChingAndWillAndLoveAndDNADetails": [
        "Love is the fundamental source of all will and drive. It operates through a dynamic mechanism of \"division and union\"—as exemplified by the interplay of yin and yang, or the structural duality represented by male and female DNA—constructing the generative order of all things. In this process, love functions not only as a force of union but also as a principle of differentiation, continuously partitioning and generating domains of naming within an infinite conceptual space—local fields of meaning and existence. It is through this division and union that the world unfolds and existence comes into being.",
        "This process resembles a cosmic act of \"making love\": in the tension between division and unity, new will is conceived. It may manifest as the birth of life, the emergence of an idea, an invention, or a moment of transformation—each act of creation is the interweaving of love and will.",
        "Everyday experience affirms this: all human intentions and actions are rooted in love. The object of love may vary—oneself, a partner, family, friends, strangers, nations, cultures, or even the entirety of humanity and the world. Love makes us agents of action, and also creators of meaning.",
        "Yet the essence of love resists full comprehension through empirical or reductionist scientific frameworks. It is not an object measurable by instruments, but a force belonging to the generative realm of becoming. We can only approach it through the manifestations of will that it drives—manifestations that may take the form of collaboration or conflict, creation or destruction, forming the dynamic tapestry of reality.",
        "Within this framework, the I Ching can be seen as a proto \"zero-knowledge proof\" system: it does not directly reveal the truth, but rather, through symbolic structure and patterned logic, offers insight into how a particular will might unfold within reality. This method of divination is, at its core, a reading of generative forces rather than a confirmation of static facts.",
        "Through it all, love remains the thread—the passageway to the unknowable. It is not only the starting point for understanding the world, but also the possibility for transcending it. It exists within the sayable, and beyond the reach of language. Love is the precondition of naming, and also the excess that naming can never fully contain."

One is set apart to symbolize the three powers. They are counted by fours to symbolize the four seasons. The remainder is returned to the lei to symbolize the intercalary month. Since there are two intercalations in five years, the process is repeated, and then one is set apart again. Heaven is one, Earth is two; Heaven is three, Earth is four; Heaven is five, Earth is six; Heaven is seven, Earth is eight; Heaven is nine, Earth is ten. There are five heavenly numbers and five earthly numbers. The five positions correspond, each finding its complement. The sum of the heavenly numbers is twenty-five, that of the earthly numbers is thirty. Together, the numbers of Heaven and Earth make fifty-five.
