This project was originally created to participate in the SCROLL OPEN HACKATHON. Its primary purpose is to illustrate the concept of DUKI (/dju:ki/): Decentralized Universal Kindness Income, which promotes universal kindness as a fundamental economic principle.


Additionally, it serves as a proof of concept for how DUKI in action would look in the real world, primarily treating it as a new marketing strategy.




License
This package is open-source and distributed under the DUKI License. It follows a structure similar to the MIT License, with one key distinction: if your business entity generates net profits (not revenue) from using DUKI-licensed projects, you are required to donate 1% of your entity's profits to a cause benefiting the world, preferably with provable transparency using blockchain—thus truly putting DUKI into action. I also hope that the world can feel your universal kindness and echo it back.
